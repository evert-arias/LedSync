# LedSync Arduino Library

[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](http://doge.mit-license.org)

## Introduction

This library allows you to blink as many LEDs and NeoPixels as you want synchronously without interfering each other progress.



## Dependencies

This library has two dependencies:

* [Adafruit_NeoPixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) created by [Adafruit Industries](https://github.com/adafruit)
* [LinkedList](https://github.com/ivanseidel/LinkedList) created by [ivanseidel](https://github.com/ivanseidel)

You must have them installed in your environment in order for it to compile.



## Getting started



### Creating a LED Object

This object represents a LED with all its methods and properties. You must create one of this objects for each connected LED.

``` c++
// Led Object
// pin: The number of the pin where the LED is connected.
Led myLed(pin);
```

[LED Object Methods](/Led.md)



### Creating NeoPixel Object

This object represents a NeoPixel with all its methods and properties. You must create one of this objects for each connected NeoPixel. The order in which these objects are created must match their position in the NeoPixelStrip. 

``` c++
// NeoPixel Object
NeoPixel myPixel;
```

 [NeoPixel Object Methods](/NeoPixel.md)



### Adding Objects to LedSync

LedSync is the core processor, you must add to it all instances of LEDs and NeoPixels. Don't forget to pass them as reference, otherwise it won't compile.

``` c++
void setup(){
  // Add the LED Object
  LedSync.add(&myLed);
  // Add the NeoPixel Object
  LedSync.add(&myPixel);
}
```



### Feed it 

In order for LedSync to work, it must have a feeding from the program loop, so don't forget to always call ```LedSync.update()``` in the loop.

```` c++
void loop(){
  LedSync.update();
}
````



## That's it!  

You are now ready to start calling the methods of your LEDs and NeoPixels.
